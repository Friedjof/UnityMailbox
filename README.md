# UnityMailbox
This project aims to make it easier for people in a residential home to get in touch with their neighbors.
Only the apartment number is needed for registration and an email address.
After verification, you can specifically write to an apartment and also receive messages from others.
Thus, this platform helps to get in touch, for example, to announce that a package is in the hallway or if the neighbor is too loud.

> Important: Chats are not end-to-end encrypted and can be viewed by the administrator.
> This is to address possible misuse or harassment.
